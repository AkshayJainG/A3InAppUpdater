# Usage

## Initialize the InAppUpdateManager
```Kotlin
    inAppUpdateManager = InAppUpdateManager(activity)
```

## Subscribe to updates 
```Kotlin
    inAppUpdateStatusDisposable = inAppUpdateManager.observeInAppUpdateStatus()
        .subscribe { currentStatus ->
            if (currentStatus.isUpdatePending()) { //just start the update if there is one in progress
                inAppUpdateManager.startUpdate()
            }
            updateUI(currentStatus) // update the ui when a new status arrives
        }
```

## Update Mode
There are two modes
* Flexible *(default)* - User can use the app during update download, installation and restart needs to be triggered by user

* Immediate - User will be blocked until download and installation is finished, restart is triggered automatically


#### Set update to immediate mode
```Kotlin
    inAppUpdateManager.setImmediateUpdate()
```


### How to setup the demo app

In App Updates needs a newer version of the app available in Play Store.

1. Add a SigningConfig to build.gradle
2. Set versionCode to 9000
3. Set a unique application id
4. Generate APK / AAB
5. Upload APK / AAB to your play store account
6. Do not use App signing ( Google will resign your app, so you cannot test it with local installations)
7. Release app to play store (app must be published and available)
8. Set versionCode to a lower number
9. Run app 


### Any Troubles?

* In-app updates are available only to user accounts that own the app. So, make sure the account youâ€™re using has downloaded your app from Google Play at least once before using the account to test in-app updates.
* Make sure that the app that you are testing in-app updates with has the same application ID and is signed with the same signing key as the one available from Google Play.
